The Murmur is a tortured soul that can only be found deep in the bowels of the overworld, even deeper than Cave Centipedes.
What appears to be a harmless person is actually an undead monster with a serpentine neck, which it can extend further than 50 blocks.
When a Murmur spots prey, it will extend its neck upwards to get a good look, then sweep forwards quickly to bite its prey and quickly retreat.
If a Murmur's head is hit rather than its body, it will only receive half of the damage.

If slain, a Murmur can drop red wool, an Elastic Tendon or, rarely, a Unsettling Kimono.
The Elastic Tendons can be combined with Dropbear claws to create the Tendon Whip.

This medium-range melee weapon can be swung like a sword, and will deal damage to up to three nearby mobs, with descending damage. It can be used from over 8 blocks away, and can automatically find a target.
The whip can be repaired with Elastic Tendons.
<NEWLINE>
the Unsettling Kimono can be work as a chestplate. Although it has low armor and durability, it increases the wearer's placement distance by two blocks, and makes most undead hostile mobs neutral to their presence - except for other murmurs and the Wither.
It can be repaired with wool.

Although Murmurs can usually be found at great depths, they can also rarely appear at the surface in Cherry Groves.
