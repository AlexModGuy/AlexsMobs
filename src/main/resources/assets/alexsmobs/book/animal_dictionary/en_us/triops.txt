Triops are small, shrimp-like crustaceans found in bodies of water in desert biomes.
They are very primitive creatures, characterized by their hardiness and three compound eyes.
Triops are well-known for consuming the larva of mosquitoes, and terrify any mosquitoes they encounter.

If a carrot is tossed to a Triops, it will look for a mate who has also been fed a carrot in order to breed.
The Triops will then lay their eggs on the water, which will hatch into baby Triops if given enough time.
Alternatively, these eggs can be broken and used to create Mosquito Repellent Stew, a food that will make Crimson Mosquitoes avoid those who eat it like the plague.

Triops can be captured using a water bucket.
