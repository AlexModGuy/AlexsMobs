Potoos are lazy birds found only within dark forest biomes.

They will attempt to remain on their perch and sleep through the day, becoming slightly more active at night.
The Potoo's survival strategy depends on it fooling its predators and prey that it is part of a tree, so Potoos will look for any leaves or logs to perch on.
Once perched, they will seldom leave, unless they spot a small insect flying through the air.

The Potoo's massive eyes contain pupils that scale with the brightness of their surroundings.
If the bird is in a location where it is dark enough for monsters to spawn, it will consistently shriek and its pupils will take up most of its eye.

Potoos can easily be handled and moved by using a Falconry Glove on them. They can be bred with maggots.
