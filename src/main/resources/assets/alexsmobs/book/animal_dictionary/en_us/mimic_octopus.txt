The Mimic Octopus is a curious, passive cephalopod found in warm oceans. Prey to many other animals, the Mimic Octopus relies on its rapid regeneration and its ability to change shape and color to survive.
The octopus can change color to match any block it decides to, and is known to mimic Pufferfish, Creepers and Guardians if any are nearby. When mimicking a block, the creature is almost invisible to any predators.

Mimic Octopi can be tamed by a player by feeding them five to eight Lobster tails, but only when they are not actively camouflaged. Although naturally passive, tamed Mimics will attempt to scare any would-be attackers of their owners by changing form, often into a monster.
Once tamed, the Octopus can follow its owner onto land, but one must note that they can dry out in this toxic environment. A slimeball can be applied every few days in order to nullify this. By interacting with a tame Mimic Octopus with an ink sac, one can toggle whether or not it should randomly change form.
By using a Prismarine shard on an octopus, it can remember and take the form of a Guardian. The same is true for Pufferfish and Creeper drops. None of these 'reminders' consume the item.

Like other tamable creatures, these octopi can be commanded to sit, wander or follow. If one applies five to eight mimicream to a Mimic Octopus, it can learn to not only mimic the shape of creatures, but their abilities in combat.
These octopi can shoot beams as Guardians, stab with poison spikes as Pufferfish, and explode as Creepers.

Tamed Mimic Octopi can be bucketed, and bred with tropical fish. One should make sure not to keep any Mimic Octopi near any sharks or Mantis Shrimps, their natural predators.
