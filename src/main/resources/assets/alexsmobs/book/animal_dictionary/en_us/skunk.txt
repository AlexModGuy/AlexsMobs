Skunks are mammals that can occasionally be found wandering through forests. They are naturally very skittish and will attempt to flee from any large predator they encounter.
If relentlessly chased through the forest or hurt somehow, the Skunk will defend itself by releasing a noxious spray all over its pursuer, inflicting nausea.

Some of this spray can even linger in the world, clinging to the surfaces the Skunk has sprayed apon. It can be bottled in order to obtain Stink in a Bottle, which is used as fuel for the Stink Ray.

The Stink Ray is a uniquely powerful tool that can be used to distract swarms of hostile or neutral mobs. If fired at a creature, nearby neutral and hostile creatures will blame it for the horrendous smell and begin targeting it, whilst passive animals will attempt to flee.
Thus the Stink Ray can be used to quickly cause havoc amongst a group of mobs. Each bottle consumed only supplies it five uses.

Skunks can be bred with sweet berries. If a skunk is inflicted with a potion effect whilst spraying, it will create a lingering cloud of the effect nearby. Only adult skunks can spray.
