Giant Squid are large invertebrates only found in the deepest of ocean biomes. Although fearsome, Giant Squid are neutral towards most, unless they are a guardian or a fish.
These invertebrates possess the largest eye in the animal kingdom. If slain, a giant squid will drop little more than a few ink sacs. However, if attacked by one of its only predators, the Cachalot Whale, this squid may lose a tentacle in the ensuing battle.
These Lost Tentacles can be gathered by a player to create the Grappling Squok.

This grappling aperatus allows one to shoot up to four tentacles at a time, latching onto any surface and pulling them towards it. It is very convient for caving and ocean exploration.

Giant Squid can become depressurized if under less than ten blocks of water, and will take on a pale coloration.
Rarely, if a normal squid is struck by lighting, it can transform into a unique blue Giant Squid.
