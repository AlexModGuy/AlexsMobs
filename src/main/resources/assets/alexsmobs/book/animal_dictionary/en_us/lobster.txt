Lobsters are small, aquatic crustaceans that can be found underwater in beach biomes. If attacked, lobsters can pinch any
aggressive mob nearby, but will not pursue or chase them. Although most commonly red, lobsters can also come in other, rarer colors.
If slain, Lobsters occasionally drop their delicious tails, which can be cooked. They can also be bucketed like any species of fish.
