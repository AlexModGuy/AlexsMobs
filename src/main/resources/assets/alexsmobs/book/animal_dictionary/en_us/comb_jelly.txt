Comb Jellies are simple gelatinous creatures that are at the very limit of the definition of animal life.
They can be found at night in frozen oceans, where their flashing prismatic colors constrast against the blue deep.
Far from intelligent, Comb Jellies simply drift in the water, sifting out microscopic prey. They can be captured with a water bucket and come in multiple colors.

If slain, Comb Jellies can drop Rainbow Jelly. This Rainbow Jelly can be used on almost any mob to color it in a flashing rainbow pattern, similar to the Comb Jelly's.
This rainbow can be removed by using a sponge on the creature. One can also eat the jelly to apply this effect to themselves.

Rainbow Jelly can also be crafted with 8 glass to create Rainbow Glass, which changes color based off of its position in the world. Unlike dark glass, Rainbow Glass also emits light.
