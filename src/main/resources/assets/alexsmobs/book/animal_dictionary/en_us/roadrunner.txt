The Roadrunner is a medium sized bird that can be found running across deserts and badlands. It is extremely quick and
nimble for its size. Roadrunners often come into conflict with Rattlesnakes, other desert denizens, their natural prey.
The bird's feathers are highly sought after due to a belief that they can be used to create boots that
allow their wearer to run fast on sand.
