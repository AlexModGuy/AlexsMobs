The Rocky Roller is a giant, aggressive monster found exclusively within the Dripstone Caves. Suited with a shell covered in pointed dripstone, this monster does not take kindly to intruders and seeks to crush them by rolling towards them at high speeds.
Although they have relatively low health for a monster, they have extremely thick armor and high damage, making them a threat to any spelunker.

If slain, the Rocky Roller can drop tuff, pointed dripstone and a Rocky Shell. This shell can be used to craft a chestplate that enables it's wearer to roll just like a Rocky Roller when sprinting. This rolling ability allows one to both travel quickly and to ram into others to deal a slight amount of damage.
Fall damage is also decreased while wearing this item, yet if worn in water, one can find themselves sinking quickly under its impressive weight.
