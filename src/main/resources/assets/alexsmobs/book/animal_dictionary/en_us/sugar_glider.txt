Sugar Gliders are small, arboreal marsupials found in birch forests.
They will often climb tree logs or leaves and glide to other trees throughout the forest.

Sugar Gliders can be tamed by feeding them sweet berries, their favorite food.
Tamed Sugar Gliders can be made to stay, follow or wander.
They can also be placed on one's head by sneaking and interacting with them.
When a Sugar Glider is on its owner's head, they will experience slow falling.

Occasionally, tamed Sugar Gliders will forage through leaf blocks for items.
Usually these are junk such as saplings or sticks, but sometimes valuable items like arrows, Hair of Bear, or Moose Antlers can be found.

Sugar Gliders can be bred with honeycombs. Baby Sugar Gliders are incapable of gliding.
