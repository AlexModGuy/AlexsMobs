Terrapins, or River Turtles, are small reptiles occasionally found submersed in ice-free river biomes.
They are completely passive and rely on their shell for protection. Wild terrapins can be picked up with a water bucket.

If a Terrapin is jumped on, it will recede into its shell. If jumped on again, the turtle will spin in the direction of the jumper, ricocheting off of walls.
If it collides with another mob, the speedy turtle will deal a decent amount of damage. However, this mob could become aggressive towards whomever launched a turtle at them.

Terrapins come in a vast array of patterns and colors, many of which do not appear in nature.
These turtles can be bred with seagrass in order to produce 1-4 eggs. Although most of these eggs should be a direct cross between their parents, there is a chance for a baby turtle to mutate a completely random color.
If the turtle is not mutated then its colors may be one of its parents or an average of the two.
