Mudskippers are fish that paradoxically spend most of their time walking on land.
They can be found exclusively within the mangrove swamp biome.
Occasionally, when two Mudskippers meet, they will raise their fins and begin circling each other in order to establish dominance.
Mudskippers are equally at home on land as they are in water.

A Mudskipper can be tamed by feeding it several Lobster Tails.
Tamed Mudskippers can be made to stay, follow or wander.
When its owner is threatened, a Mudskipper will spit a ball of mud from its mouth at its opponent, which inflicts slowness and deals some damage.
Mudskippers can also strafe in combat.

They can be bred with any insect larva or Lobster Tails.
